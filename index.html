<h1>The Boys In The Band</h1>
<div class="para">New Kids on the Block is an American boy band from Dorchester, Massachusetts, United States.  Assembled in 1984 under the guidance of producer Maurice Starr, the band rose to success in the late 1980s until they decided to disband in 1994.  During that time, they sold more than 80 million records worldwide and performed at sold out venues worldwide. In 2008 the band announced they would be releasing a new album and were going on tour.  Since their reunion they have released two albums, have had numerous tours, and have hosted several sold out cruises. The bandâ€™s members are Donnie Wahlberg, Jordan Knight, Jonathan Knight, Danny Wood, and Joey McIntyre. </div>
